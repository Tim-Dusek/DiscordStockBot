# Discord Stock Bot
A bot that can be used on Discord to automate different functions and features.
It also has custom commands I have created to aid in stock market news / investing.

I created this bot to get more familiar with Python as well as code something my friends and I can have around for fun in our discord channel.

Required Libraries:

pip install google

pip install beautifulsoup4

pip install discord.py

pip install yfinance

pip install lxml
